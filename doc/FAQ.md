# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Robocomp?

Robocomp is an Open-Source Robotics Framework, where you can simulate, model and program your own robots, in a C.O.P (Component Oriented Programming) enviroment. You can create components and share them with the community. Components communicate with each other via [Ice](https://doc.zeroc.com/ice/3.7/introduction), a framework for building distributed applications.

Robocomp was presented with the publication of [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262179907_RoboComp_A_Tool-Based_Robotics_Framework_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science). You can see more projects from Robolab, the investigation team from Universidad de Extremadura that created and currently maintains Robocomp [here](robolab.unex.es) (some of the information is in Spanish).

## What to do if you are new to the project and want to help?

Thank you for wanting to improve the project! 

So you are informed, please first read [the Contributing Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md), and the documentation for the project. [Here](https://robocomp.github.io/web/blog) you can see the list of projects for Google Summer of Code for some ideas on what is needed. If you need additional help, drop a message on [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=es#!forum/robocomp-dev) or [Gitter](https://gitter.im/robocomp).

If you make your own project with Robocomp, we would love to hear about it. Tell us at robocomp.team@gmail.com.

## What kind of work can you do to improve Robocomp?

You can contribute with all types of skills. Web design for our webpage, technical documentation for the docs, UX and UI design for the simulator, image processing to make the Learnbot more interactive for kids, programming to make Robocomp work with other languages like JavaScript, and many more. You can help in any way you want and are able to.

See the projects done in [Google Summer of Code](https://robocomp.github.io/web/blog/) for some ideas.

## In which branch should you make changes?

Our up-to-date branch is currently `highlyunstable`. If you are going to file an issue or make an improvement, this is the branch to do it.

## How should I download Robocomp?

Follow the install guide from the repo Readme page, or for a faster way, use [this installation script](../InstallScript.md). 

To use the installation script you need to download the Raw of the file, then from the terminal:

```bash
# To check that the script is there
ls
# Make it executable
chmod +x installScript.sh
# Then you can run it
./installScript.sh
```

Here is a gif illustrating the process:

## How can Windows, Arch Linux, Linux Mint or any other Operating System that is not Ubuntu be used?

At the moment is not possible to use Robocomp directly in another Linux distro or on Windows. However, you can use virtualization and use Ubuntu inside your machine!

If your computer have at least 8 GB of RAM, you can use VMware or VirtualBox to have an Ubuntu image running inside your OS.

You need to download an Ubuntu image from [OS boxes](https://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu/), run either VMware or VirtualBox, and load it. After that you will have a perfect Ubuntu system running, from where you can use Robocomp.

## How can you create your own 3D Models?

These are written in *Extensible Markup Language* [XML](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-newxml/index.html), a standard markup language which help you create your own elements.
