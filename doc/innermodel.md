# Introduction to InnerModel: RoboComp's internal representation of the world and the robot itself.

**InnerModel** is a C++ group of classes used by RoboComp to represent the world and and the robot in it. As a data structure, InnerModel is a tree whose nodes represent entities in the world and geometric transformations among those entities. The current list of entities include:

*Geometry*
- innermodel
- transform
- translation
- rotation

*Bodies*
- mesh
- plane 

*Robots*
- differentialrobot
- omnirobot

*Actuators*
- prismaticjoint
- joint

*Sensors*
- laser
- pointcloud
- touchsensor
- display
- imu
- rgbd


A tree made up of elements (robots, bodies, sensors and actuators) connected through 6D geomtric tranformations is a _kinematic tree_ . The basic relationship among elements is "part_of" meaning that a child is rigidly attached to her parent and wim move with it. The precise position of the child with respect to her parent is encoded in an intermediate node that will typically  be a _transform_ (6D geometric transformation). It also can be divided in a _translation_ or a _rotation_.

The InnerMdel tree can be expressed as an XML file. This file can be written to disk at any time or read from a file when the components start. Once in memory, the InnerModel class holds a tree data structure and offers an API to access and modifiy its nodes and edges.

Let's start with a simple XML file describing a 5000mm x 5000mm square, a few boxes on it and a differential drive robot endowed with a laser and an RGBD camera:

The whole world is embraced inside the <innermodel> </innermodel> tag. Inside it we can see the following tags:
- 1 transform with id "world"
  - 1 transform with id "floor"
    - 1 plane for the floor object with nice wood texture
    - 4 planes for the walls
    - 1 transform for the object
      - 1 plane(box) for the object
    - 1 differentialrobot object
        - 1 mesh for the robot's body representation
	- 1 translation to position the laser
	  - 1 laser
	    1 1 plane for the laser's body representation
      and so on for the rgbd camera ...
