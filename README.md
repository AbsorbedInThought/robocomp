robocomp
========

RoboComp is a robotics framework providing a set of open-source, distributed, real-time robotic and artificial vision software components and the necessary tools to create and manage them.
It is mainly a response to the need of quickly creating and modifying software components. Currently, RoboComp is  request/reply native, but can also communicate through a publish/subscribe mechanism. It is not unusual that one component requires, subscribes, implements and publishes, all at once. To build components, RoboComp provides 2 domain specific languages: IDSL and PDSL, and a C++ generator. IDSL is an Interface Definition Language used to define interfaces, which represent abstract functionalities shown by components, in a similar way as an include file does for a class in C++. PDSL includes IDSLs to define the actual components, what interfaces they implement, publish, require o subscribes to. With this information, the code generator creates a C++ source subtree, based on CMake, that compiles and executes flawlessly.
