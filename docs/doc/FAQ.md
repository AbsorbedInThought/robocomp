# Frequently Asked Questions

## What to do if you are new to the project and want to help?

Thank you for wanting to improve the project! 

So you are informed, please first read [the Contributing Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md), and the documentation for the project. [Here](https://robocomp.github.io/web/blog/gsoc/ideas2018) you can see the list of projects for Google Summer of Code for some ideas on what is needed. If you need additional help, drop a message on [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=es#!forum/robocomp-dev) or [Gitter](https://gitter.im/robocomp).

If you make your own project with Robocomp, we would love to see it. Tell us about it at robocomp.team@gmail.com.

## In which branch should you make changes?

Our up-to-date branch is currently `highlyunstable`. If you are going to file an issue or make an improvement, this is the branch to do it. 

## How should I download Robocomp?

Follow the install guide, or for a faster way, use [this script](../InstallScript.md). 

You need to download the Raw of the file, then from the terminal:

```bash
# To check that the script is there
ls
# Make it executable
chmod +x installScript.sh
# Then you can run it
./installScript.sh
```

## How can Windows, Arch Linux, Linux Mint or any other Operating System that is not Ubuntu be used?

At the moment is not possible to use Robocomp directly in another Linux distro or on Windows. However, you can use virtualization and use Ubuntu inside your machine!

If your computer have at least 8 GB of RAM, you can use VMware or VirtualBox to have an Ubuntu image running inside your OS.

You need to download an Ubuntu image from [OS boxes](https://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu/), run either VMware or VirtualBox, and load it. After that you will have a perfect Ubuntu system running, from where you can use Robocomp.

## How can you create your own 3D Models?

These are written in *Extensible Markup Language* [XML](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-newxml/index.html), a standard markup language which help you create your own elements.

## How should you file an Issue?

Please see our ['Contributing'](../CONTRIBUTING.md)  file for more information.
